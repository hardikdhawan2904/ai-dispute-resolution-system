## Data Flow — Form vs Database

**Save-first architecture.** The customer form is saved to `dispute_cases` before any agent runs. All agents read from the database — never from the raw form in memory.

At submission time, key fields are overwritten from the bank's own records:
- `email`, `phone` → from `bank_customers` (never trust form values)
- `amount`, `merchant`, `transaction_type` → from `transactions` (never trust form values)

**DB-first fraud scoring (ARIA).** `score_fraud_indicators` queries `account_events` for bank-verified signals before trusting form flags. DB-verified signals carry full weight; unverifiable customer claims (otp_shared, bank_impersonation, remote_access) carry 60% weight.

---

## Agents

### Agent 1 — ARIA (Dispute Understanding Agent)

Reads the customer's dispute data from `dispute_cases` (already saved). Runs 3 pre-computed tools server-side before the LLM call.

**Tools:**
- `assess_transaction_context` — RBI liability tiers, off-hours risk, CNP channel flags, UPI/IMPS patterns (reads form metadata — factual timestamps, not interpretable customer claims)
- `score_fraud_indicators` — DB-first fraud scoring. Queries `account_events` for bank-verified signals first, falls back to form flags at 60% weight. Unverifiable claims (otp_shared, bank_impersonation, remote_access, screen_sharing, phishing_link, device_lost) are narrative context only.
- `verify_evidence_match` — OCR document text vs claimed merchant, amount, and document type

**DB-verified signals in score_fraud_indicators:**

| account_events type | Replaces form field |
|---|---|
| `SIM_SWAP_DETECTED` | `sim_swap_suspected` |
| `DEVICE_REGISTERED` + `customer_devices` | `new_device` |
| `MOBILE_NUMBER_CHANGED` | `mobile_number_changed` |
| `CARD_LOST_REPORTED` | `card_lost` |
| `CARD_BLOCKED` | `card_blocked` |
| `OTP_DELIVERED` | `otp_received` |
| `CUSTOMER_CONTACT_LOGGED` | `bank_contacted` |
| `UPI_COLLECT_REQUEST_RECEIVED` | `collect_request` |

**Fraud signal score → used for:**
1. LLM prompt context (written explanation of fraud signals)
2. `confidence_score` adjustment: CRITICAL/HIGH + correct fraud category = +0.15, MEDIUM = +0.08, wrong category = −0.12

**Outputs:** `dispute_category`, `fraud_suspicion`, `confidence_score`, `risk_tags`, `evidence_match`, `key_findings`, `case_summary`

---

### Agent 2 — IIA (Investigation Intelligence Agent)

Runs 4 database-backed tools to design a targeted investigation plan. **100% DB — no form data.**

**Tools:**
- `lookup_customer_history` — dispute frequency, fraud-flag count, chargeback ratios, risk level. Reads: `dispute_cases`, `dispute_history`
- `check_merchant_risk` — category risk, complaint volume, blacklist status, fraud rate. Reads: `merchant_profiles`, `dispute_cases`, `dispute_history`
- `find_duplicate_transaction` — identical merchant/amount/date within 72-hour window. Reads: `dispute_cases`, `transactions`
- `lookup_related_cases` — outcomes of similar historical disputes. Reads: `dispute_history`, `dispute_cases`

**Outputs:** `investigation_plan`, `required_documents`, `recommended_queue`, `investigation_complexity`, `recommended_steps`

---

### Agent 3 — WOA (Workflow Orchestration Agent)

Acts as the authoritative workflow controller. **100% DB — reads from `dispute_cases` only.** Compliance review has been removed — high-risk tags trigger escalation, not a separate agent.

**Routing logic:**
- `FRAUD_AGENT` — if `fraud_suspicion = true` OR Unauthorized Transaction / Friendly Fraud category
- `EVIDENCE_AGENT` — if document gaps exist, ATM Cash Issue, Other
- `MERCHANT_AGENT` — Merchant Dispute, Refund Not Received, Product Not Received, Subscription Abuse, Duplicate Transaction

**Tools:** `evaluate_case_complexity`, `determine_required_agents`, `recommend_workflow_path`, `assess_escalation_need`, `estimate_workload`, `determine_next_execution_step`

**`workflow_reasoning` uses factual/past tense** ("was activated", "triggered") — not future/action tense ("is required", "must be done").

**Outputs:** `workflow_path`, `required_agents`, `next_agent`, `workflow_complexity`, `escalation_required`, `analyst_level`, `estimated_investigation_hours`

---

### Agent 4 — FRIA (Fraud Reasoning Agent)

**48 fraud intelligence tools across 4 transaction channels.** All tools run in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. All numeric fraud scores are server-side deterministic. The LLM synthesises narrative reasoning only. Form fields do **not** contribute to `fraud_probability` — they appear in the LLM narrative only.

#### Channel Routing

| Channel | Transaction Types |
|---|---|
| **UPI** | UPI |
| **Internet Banking** | Net Banking, Mobile Banking, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS |
| **Card POS** | Debit Card, Credit Card |
| **ATM** | ATM, ATM Cash, Cash Withdrawal |

`device_id` is NULL for Card POS and ATM in the DB — POS terminals and ATMs are merchant/bank hardware, not customer devices.

#### Fraud Probability Formula

```
fraud_probability = clamp(channel_signals + min(0.60, universal_signals), 0.00, 1.00)

Channel signals (examples):
  Unauthorized Transaction base         +0.15
  Amount anomaly 2×–5×                  +0.15
  Amount anomaly > 5×                   +0.25
  Geovelocity CRITICAL (≥ 900 km/h)     +0.35
  Unrecognized device (digital only)    +0.30
  Card entry MANUAL_ENTRY               +0.30
  EMV fallback detected                 +0.25
  Merchant blacklisted                  +0.50
  Merchant CRITICAL risk                +0.30
  (+ all channel-specific tool scores above)

Universal signals (capped at 0.60):
  Bank-verified ATO sequence HIGH       +0.20
  Bank-verified ATO sequence CRITICAL   +0.30
  New device + large transfer (CRITICAL)+0.40
  Mule account indicators               +0.30
  (+ other universal tool scores above)

Risk Levels:  LOW < 0.15 · MEDIUM < 0.40 · HIGH < 0.75 · CRITICAL ≥ 0.75
```

---

### Agent 5 — EIA (Evidence Intelligence Agent)

Audits evidence completeness and consistency. **100% DB — reads from `dispute_cases` and `document_requests`.**

**Tools:**
- `evaluate_evidence_completeness` — required docs vs fulfilled requests + upload count
- `identify_missing_evidence` — unfulfilled customer document gaps
- `validate_evidence_consistency` — amount/merchant/date vs original `transactions` record
- `assess_evidence_strength` — weighted: ARIA verdict + completeness + IIA data quality
- `determine_next_document_request` — next formal document request (deduplicates pending)

**Outputs:** `evidence_completeness`, `evidence_strength`, `missing_documents`, `investigation_blocked`, `recommended_document_requests`

---

### Agent 6 — CCA (Customer Communication Agent)

Generates and delivers professional HTML email notifications. Fires asynchronously — never blocks the workflow.

**8 notification types (6 customer-facing, 2 internal-suppressed):**

| Type | Trigger | Auto |
|---|---|---|
| `CASE_RECEIVED` | Case submitted | Once per case |
| `INVESTIGATION_STARTED` | IIA completes | Once per case |
| `DOCUMENT_REQUESTED` | Analyst creates document request | Every action |
| `CASE_RESOLVED` | Case resolved / closed / rejected | Once per case |
| `STATUS_CHANGED` | Major status transition | On transition |
| `DOCUMENTS_RECEIVED` | Customer uploads documents | Every upload |
| `FRAUD_REVIEW_STARTED` | Internal — **suppressed** from auto-send | Manual only |
| `EVIDENCE_REVIEW_COMPLETED` | Internal — **suppressed** from auto-send | Manual only |

**Delivery:** Outlook SMTP (`smtp.office365.com:587` TLS). Demo mode redirects all mail to `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`.

## Key Design Decisions

**DB-first fraud scoring, not form-first.**
ARIA's `score_fraud_indicators` queries `account_events` before trusting any customer form flag. Bank-verified events (SIM_SWAP_DETECTED, OTP_DELIVERED, CARD_LOST_REPORTED, etc.) carry full scoring weight. Unverifiable customer claims (otp_shared, bank_impersonation, remote_access) carry 60% weight and are narrative context only.

**Social engineering signals appear in narrative, not in score.**
`otp_shared`, `bank_impersonation`, `remote_access`, `screen_sharing`, `phishing_link` — these represent human interactions (phone calls, verbal OTP sharing) that no bank system can record. They inform the LLM's written explanation of the fraud but do not contribute to `fraud_probability`.

**FRIA is channel-aware — 48 tools, 4 channels.**
Card POS and ATM get different tool sets than UPI and Internet Banking. Device fingerprint and KYC match are disabled for Card POS/ATM at the DB level (`device_id = NULL`, `card_entry_mode` column only populated for card transactions). The Fraud Review tab adapts per channel — Identity Status shows for digital, Card Authentication shows for Card POS.

**LLM produces narrative — deterministic code produces numbers.**
`fraud_probability`, `confidence_score`, `trust_score`, and all risk levels are computed server-side. The LLM is given pre-computed tool results and asked to explain them. Post-processing corrects known LLM errors: strips score weights from findings, corrects merchant tier misattribution.

**GPS Haversine geovelocity — not string matching.**
Location velocity uses actual lat/lng coordinates from `transactions.latitude/longitude`. Haversine distance calculation gives speed in km/h. Thresholds: MEDIUM ≥ 150, HIGH ≥ 500, CRITICAL ≥ 900 km/h. Card POS/ATM have NULL coordinates (merchant location, not customer GPS).

**Universal tool contribution is capped at 0.60.**
Universal signals run on all channels. Without a cap, they could make channel-specific tools irrelevant. Channel tools always contribute meaningfully on top.

**WOA is the single routing authority. COMPLIANCE_AGENT removed.**
High-risk tags (VELOCITY_BREACH, OTP_COMPROMISED, DEVICE_MISMATCH) now trigger escalation to a senior analyst — not a separate compliance agent. WOA routes to three agents only: FRAUD_AGENT, EVIDENCE_AGENT, MERCHANT_AGENT.

**Behavioral patterns are deduplicated.**
Cases appearing in both `dispute_cases` (live) and `dispute_history` (resolved) are counted once using `case_id` deduplication before computing velocity.

**CCA is noise-controlled.**
One-shot types (CASE_RECEIVED, INVESTIGATION_STARTED, CASE_RESOLVED) fire at most once per case. STATUS_CHANGED fires only for major customer-visible transitions.
